This is a voice recorder in Python.

You would need to install "sounddevice" and "scipy" libraries to run this program.

To install these, use,
**`pip3 install sounddevice`** and **`pip3 install scipy`** in the bash terminal.

You can set the duration of the recording (in seconds) upon running the program.

The recording will be saved in a .wav file named as **"output.wav"**
